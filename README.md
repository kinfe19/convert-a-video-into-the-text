# Extract Text From Videos using Python

This Python project demonstrates how to extract text from videos using Python. You can use this method to convert spoken words in a video into text, which can be useful for various applications, such as transcription, content analysis, and more.

## Getting Started

Follow the steps below to get started with this project.

### Prerequisites

Before running the code, you'll need to install two Python libraries:

- **SpeechRecognition**: Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install SpeechRecognition
  ```

- **moviepy**: Install it using pip:
  ```bash
  pip install moviepy
  ```

### Usage

1. **Download a Video**: Begin by downloading the video from which you want to extract text. Make sure you have the video file on your local machine.

2. **Run the Python Code**: Use the following Python code to extract text from the video. Replace `"your_video_file.mp4"` with the actual path to your video file.

    ```python
    import moviepy.editor as mp
    import speech_recognition as sr

    # Load the video file
    video = mp.VideoFileClip("your_video_file.mp4")

    # Extract audio from the video
    audio = video.audio

    # Initialize the speech recognizer
    recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

    # Convert audio to text
    with sr.AudioFile("temp.wav") as source:
        audio_text = recognizer.record(source)

    # Recognize the text from audio
    try:
        text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_text)
        print("Text from video:", text)
    except sr.UnknownValueError:
        print("Could not understand the audio.")
    except sr.RequestError as e:
        print(f"Could not request results; {e}")

    # Cleanup: Remove temporary audio file
    os.remove("temp.wav")
    ```

3. **Customize**: Feel free to customize the code to suit your specific requirements. You can add error handling and additional features as needed.
