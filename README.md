# Extract Text From Videos using Python

![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.x-blue.svg)

In this section, we'll guide you on how to extract text from a video using Python. This project uses the SpeechRecognition and moviepy libraries to convert audio from a video into text.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- A video file you want to extract text from.

## Installation

To get started, install the required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install SpeechRecognition
pip install moviepy
```

## Usage

Follow these steps to extract text from a video:

1. Download the video you want to process.

2. Replace `"your_video_file.mp4"` in the following Python script with the actual path to your video file:

   ```python
   import moviepy.editor as mp
   import speech_recognition as sr

   # Load the video file
   video = mp.VideoFileClip("your_video_file.mp4")

   # Extract audio from the video
   audio = video.audio

   # Initialize the speech recognizer
   recognizer = sr.Recognizer()

   # Convert audio to text
   with sr.AudioFile("temp.wav") as source:
       audio_text = recognizer.record(source)

   # Recognize the text from audio
   try:
       text = recognizer.recognize_google(audio_text)
       print("Text from video:", text)
   except sr.UnknownValueError:
       print("Could not understand the audio.")
   except sr.RequestError as e:
       print(f"Could not request results; {e}")

   # Cleanup: Remove temporary audio file
   os.remove("temp.wav")
   ```

3. Run the Python script, and it will extract text from the video.

4. Customize the code to suit your specific requirements and add error handling if needed.
